# GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY

## WHY

Johny Cash gets angry everytime he watches TV: He can't stand watching all those politicians and do nothing about it.

Also, he has lots of "time for babe" but his babe is not in the country anymore(she was Mexican and Trump deported her) so he is looking for a new videogame to relieve his stress.


## WHAT?

A multiplayer shooting game where Johny can play with Maria Teresa(his girlfriend) and kill his worst enemies. 

After all, we were meant to satisfy the user needs...
