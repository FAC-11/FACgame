Trump, Putin, Theresa May...he is FED UP!


Also, he has lots of "time for babe" but his babe is not in the country anymore(she was Mexican and Trump deported her) so he is looking for a new videogame to relieve his stress.


## WHAT?

A multiplayer shooting game where Johny can play with Maria Teresa(his girlfriend) and kill his worst enemies.

## HOW

We still do not know how.

But what we know is that there has been a before...
